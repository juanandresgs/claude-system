# Hook System Reference

Technical reference for the Claude Code hook system. For philosophy and workflow, see `../CLAUDE.md`. For the summary table, see `../README.md`.

---

## Protocol

All hooks receive JSON on **stdin** and emit JSON on **stdout**. Stderr is for logging only. Exit code 0 = success. Non-zero = hook error (logged, does not block).

> **Caveat — SessionEnd + stderr:** Claude Code reports SessionEnd hooks as "failed" if they produce any stderr output, even with exit code 0. Suppress stderr in SessionEnd hooks (`exec 2>/dev/null`) since diagnostic messages have no audience at session termination.

### Stdin Format

```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write|Edit|Bash|...",
  "tool_input": { "file_path": "...", "command": "..." },
  "cwd": "/current/working/directory"
}
```

SubagentStart/SubagentStop hooks receive `{"agent_type": "planner|implementer|tester|guardian|Explore|general-purpose", ...}`. SubagentStop hooks additionally receive `{"last_assistant_message": "...", "agent_id": "...", "agent_transcript_path": "...", "stop_hook_active": false}` — use `.last_assistant_message` to read the agent's final response text. Stop hooks (non-subagent) receive `{"stop_hook_active": true/false}`.

### Stdout Responses (PreToolUse only)

**Deny** — block the tool call:
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "deny",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "Explanation shown to the model"
  }
}
```

**Rewrite** — transparently modify the command (model sees rewritten version):
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "Explanation",
    "updatedInput": { "command": "rewritten command here" }
  }
}
```

**Advisory** — inject context without blocking:
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "Warning or guidance text"
  }
}
```

PostToolUse hooks use `additionalContext` for feedback. Exit code 2 in lint.sh triggers a feedback loop (model retries with linter output).

### Stop Hook Responses

Stop hooks have a **different schema** from PreToolUse/PostToolUse. They do NOT accept `hookSpecificOutput`. Valid fields:

**System message** — inject context into the next turn:
```json
{
  "systemMessage": "Summary text shown as system-reminder"
}
```

> **Note**: `additionalContext` is NOT a valid field for Stop hooks. It may be silently
> processed but renders as passive context, not a `<system-reminder>`. Use `systemMessage`
> for any directive that the model must act on.

**Block** — prevent the response from completing (rare):
```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Explanation of why the response was blocked"
}
```

Stop hooks receive `{"stop_hook_active": true/false}` on stdin. Check `stop_hook_active` to prevent re-firing loops (if a Stop hook's `systemMessage` triggers another model response, the next Stop invocation will have `stop_hook_active: true`). Note: SubagentStop hooks use `last_assistant_message` for the agent response text — see the Stdin Format note above.

### Rewrite Pattern (Non-Functional in PreToolUse)

**Important:** `updatedInput` (the rewrite mechanism) is NOT supported in PreToolUse
hooks — it silently fails. The `rewrite()` function in guard.sh produces valid JSON
output but the command is NOT modified. See upstream issue anthropics/claude-code#26506.

The `updatedInput` format below is documented for reference only:
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "Explanation",
    "updatedInput": { "command": "rewritten command here" }
  }
}
```

All active command corrections in guard.sh use `deny()` instead, with the corrected
safe command in the reason message so the model can resubmit. Examples:
- `/tmp/` writes → denied; model directed to use project `tmp/` directory (Check 1)
- `--force` → denied with `--force-with-lease` alternative in message (Check 3)
- `git worktree remove` → denied; corrected safe-CWD command in message (Check 5)
- `rm -rf .worktrees/` → denied; corrected safe-CWD command in message (Check 5b)

## Shared Libraries

### log.sh — Input handling and logging

Source with: `source "$(dirname "$0")/log.sh"`

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `read_input` | Read and cache stdin JSON into `$HOOK_INPUT` (call once) |
| `get_field <jq_path>` | Extract field from cached input (e.g., `get_field '.tool_input.command'`) |
| `detect_project_root` | Returns `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` → git root → `$HOME` (fallback chain) |
| `is_same_project(dir)` | Compares `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` for current project vs target dir. Returns 0 if same repo (handles worktrees). Defined in `guard.sh` |
| `extract_git_target_dir(cmd)` | Parses `cd /path && git ...` or `git -C /path ...` to find git target directory. Falls back to CWD. Defined in `guard.sh` |
| `log_info <stage> <msg>` | Human-readable stderr log |
| `log_json <stage> <msg>` | Structured JSON stderr log |

### context-lib.sh — Project state detection

Source with: `source "$(dirname "$0")/context-lib.sh"`

| Function | Populates |
|----------|-----------|
| `get_git_state <root>` | `$GIT_BRANCH`, `$GIT_DIRTY_COUNT`, `$GIT_WORKTREES`, `$GIT_WT_COUNT` |
| `get_plan_status <root>` | `$PLAN_EXISTS`, `$PLAN_PHASE`, `$PLAN_TOTAL_PHASES`, `$PLAN_COMPLETED_PHASES`, `$PLAN_IN_PROGRESS_PHASES`, `$PLAN_AGE_DAYS`, `$PLAN_COMMITS_SINCE`, `$PLAN_CHANGED_SOURCE_FILES`, `$PLAN_TOTAL_SOURCE_FILES`, `$PLAN_SOURCE_CHURN_PCT`, `$PLAN_REQ_COUNT`, `$PLAN_P0_COUNT`, `$PLAN_NOGO_COUNT` |
| `get_session_changes <root>` | `$SESSION_CHANGED_COUNT`, `$SESSION_FILE` |
| `get_drift_data <root>` | `$DRIFT_UNPLANNED_COUNT`, `$DRIFT_UNIMPLEMENTED_COUNT`, `$DRIFT_MISSING_DECISIONS`, `$DRIFT_LAST_AUDIT_EPOCH` |
| `get_research_status <root>` | `$RESEARCH_EXISTS`, `$RESEARCH_ENTRY_COUNT` |
| `is_source_file <path>` | Tests against `$SOURCE_EXTENSIONS` regex |
| `is_skippable_path <path>` | Tests for config/test/vendor/generated paths |
| `append_audit <root> <event> <detail>` | Appends to `.claude/.audit-log` |

`$SOURCE_EXTENSIONS` is the single source of truth for source file detection: `ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|rs|go|java|kt|swift|c|cpp|h|hpp|cs|rb|php|sh|bash|zsh`

### source-lib.sh — Bootstrap loader

Source with: `source "$(dirname "$0")/source-lib.sh"`

Single-file bootstrapper that sources both `log.sh` and `context-lib.sh` with correct path resolution. Used by hooks that need the full library stack in one line.

---

## Execution Order (Session Lifecycle)

```
SessionStart    → session-init.sh (calls update-check.sh inline, then git state, update status, plan status, worktree warnings)
                    ↓
UserPromptSubmit → prompt-submit.sh (keyword-based context injection)
                    ↓
PreToolUse:Bash → guard.sh (sacred practice guardrails)
                   doc-freshness.sh (documentation freshness enforcement)
                   auto-review.sh (intelligent command auto-approval)
PreToolUse:W/E  → test-gate.sh → mock-gate.sh → branch-guard.sh → doc-gate.sh → plan-check.sh → checkpoint.sh
                    ↓
[Tool executes]
                    ↓
PostToolUse:W/E → lint.sh → track.sh → code-review.sh → plan-validate.sh → test-runner.sh (async)
                    ↓
SubagentStart   → subagent-start.sh (agent-specific context)
SubagentStop    → check-planner.sh | check-implementer.sh | check-tester.sh | check-guardian.sh | check-explore.sh | check-general-purpose.sh
                    ↓
Stop            → surface.sh (decision audit) → session-summary.sh → forward-motion.sh
                    ↓
PreCompact      → compact-preserve.sh (context preservation)
                    ↓
SessionEnd      → session-end.sh (cleanup)
```

Hooks within the same event run **sequentially** in array order from settings.json. A deny from any PreToolUse hook stops the tool call — later hooks in the chain don't run.

## Hook Details

### PreToolUse — Block Before Execution

| Hook | Matcher | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **guard.sh** | Bash | 11 checks: nuclear deny (7 catastrophic command categories), early-exit gate (non-git commands skip git-specific checks); denies `/tmp/` paths, `--force` to main, cd into .worktrees/, worktree removal without safe CWD; blocks commits on main, force push to main, destructive git (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`); requires test evidence + proof-of-work verification for commits and merges (missing state files = allow, gate only active when files exist); **blocks agents from writing approval status to `.proof-status`** and **blocks deletion of `.proof-status` when verification is active** (human gate enforcement). All git subcommand patterns use flag-tolerant matching (`git\s+[^|;&]*\bSUBCMD`) to catch `git -C /path` and other global flags. Trailing boundaries use `[^a-zA-Z0-9-]` to reject hyphenated subcommands (`commit-msg`, `merge-base`, `merge-file`) |
| **doc-freshness.sh** | Bash | Enforces documentation freshness at merge time. Blocks merges to main/master when tracked docs are critically stale (structural churn exceeds threshold). Advisory-only on feature branches. Supports bypasses: `@no-doc` annotation, doc-only commits, tier reduction when stale doc is included in the merge |
| **auto-review.sh** | Bash | Three-tier command classifier: auto-approves safe commands, defers risky ones to user. `git commit/push/merge` classified as risky (requires Guardian dispatch per Sacred Practice #8) |
| **test-gate.sh** | Write\|Edit | Escalating gate: warns on first source write with failing tests, blocks on repeat |
| **mock-gate.sh** | Write\|Edit | Detects internal mocking patterns; warns first, blocks on repeat |
| **branch-guard.sh** | Write\|Edit | Blocks source file writes on main/master branch |
| **doc-gate.sh** | Write\|Edit | Enforces file headers and @decision annotations on 50+ line files; Write = hard deny, Edit = advisory; warns on new root-level markdown files (Sacred Practice #9) |
| **plan-check.sh** | Write\|Edit | Denies source writes without MASTER_PLAN.md; composite staleness scoring (source churn % + decision drift) warns then blocks when plan diverges from code; bypasses Edit tool, small writes (<20 lines), non-git dirs |
| **checkpoint.sh** | Write\|Edit | Creates git ref-based snapshots (`refs/checkpoints/<branch>/<N>`) before source file writes. Uses temporary index + write-tree + commit-tree (zero working copy impact, no stash pollution). Tracks checkpoint frequency via `.checkpoint-counter`. Guardian cleans up refs after merge |

### PostToolUse — Feedback After Execution

| Hook | Matcher | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **lint.sh** | Write\|Edit | Auto-detects project linter (ruff, black, prettier, eslint, etc.), runs on modified files. Exit 2 = feedback loop (Claude retries the fix automatically) |
| **track.sh** | Write\|Edit | Records file changes to `.session-changes-$SESSION_ID`. Also invalidates `.proof-status` when verified source files change — ensuring the user always verifies the final state, not an intermediate one |
| **code-review.sh** | Write\|Edit | Fires on 20+ line source files (skips tests and config). Injects diff context and suggests `mcp__multi__codereview` for multi-model analysis. Falls back silently if Multi-MCP is unavailable |
| **plan-validate.sh** | Write\|Edit | Validates MASTER_PLAN.md structure on every write: phase Status fields (`planned`/`in-progress`/`completed`), Decision Log content for completed phases, original intent section preserved, DEC-COMPONENT-NNN ID format, REQ-{CATEGORY}-NNN ID format. Advisory warnings for missing Goals/Non-Goals/Requirements/Success Metrics sections and completed phases without REQ-ID references. Exit 2 = feedback loop with fix instructions |
| **test-runner.sh** | Write\|Edit | **Async** — doesn't block Claude. Auto-detects test framework (pytest, vitest, jest, npm-test, cargo-test, go-test). 2s debounce lets rapid writes settle. 10s cooldown between runs. Lock file ensures single instance (kills previous run if superseded). Writes `.test-status` (`pass\|0\|timestamp` or `fail\|count\|timestamp`) consumed by test-gate.sh and guard.sh. Reports results via `systemMessage` |
| **skill-result.sh** | Skill | Reads `.skill-result.md` from forked skills, injects as `additionalContext` to parent session. Surfaces research/analysis results from `context: fork` skills (deep-research, last30days, decide, consume-content, prd, uplevel) back to orchestrator. Truncates files over 4000 bytes. Deletes file after reading to prevent stale results. Exit 0 silently if file doesn't exist |
| **webfetch-fallback.sh** | WebFetch | Fires when WebFetch tool fails (non-200 response or error). Suggests `mcp__fetch__fetch` as alternative fetch method. Exit 0 (advisory only) |
| **playwright-cleanup.sh** | mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot | Cleanup after Playwright browser snapshots. Prevents stale browser state accumulation |

### Session Lifecycle

| Hook | Event | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **session-init.sh** | SessionStart | Calls update-check.sh inline (fixes race condition where parallel hooks caused one-session-late notifications), then injects git state, harness update status, MASTER_PLAN.md status, active worktrees, todo HUD, unresolved agent findings, preserved context from pre-compaction. Clears stale `.test-status` from previous sessions (prevents old passes from satisfying the commit gate). Resets prompt count for first-prompt fallback. **Post-compaction resume**: when `.preserved-context` exists, extracts the `RESUME DIRECTIVE:` block (computed by `build_resume_directive()` in context-lib.sh) and injects it as the first context element so it takes priority over all other state — immediately tells the model what to do next without relying on it to remember. The session event log is preserved across compaction (not reset) so trajectory context survives. Known: SessionStart has a bug ([#10373](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10373)) where output may not inject for brand-new sessions — works for `/clear`, `/compact`, resume |
| **update-check.sh** | Called by session-init.sh | Fetches origin/main, compares versions. Auto-applies safe updates (same MAJOR). Notifies for breaking changes (different MAJOR). Aborts cleanly on conflict. Writes `.update-status` consumed by session-init.sh. Disabled by `.disable-auto-update` flag file |
| **prompt-submit.sh** | UserPromptSubmit | First-prompt mitigation for SessionStart bug: on the first prompt of any session, injects full session context (same as session-init.sh) as a reliability fallback. **User verification gate**: when user expresses approval (verified, approved, lgtm, looks good, ship it) and `.proof-status = pending`, writes `verified\|timestamp` — this is the ONLY path to verified status. On subsequent prompts: keyword-based context injection — file references trigger @decision status, "plan"/"implement" trigger MASTER_PLAN phase status, "merge"/"commit" trigger git dirty state. Also: auto-claims issue refs ("fix #42"), detects deferred-work language ("later", "eventually") and suggests `/backlog`, flags large multi-step tasks for scope confirmation |
| **compact-preserve.sh** | PreCompact | Dual output: (1) persistent `.preserved-context` file that survives compaction and is re-injected by session-init.sh, and (2) `additionalContext` instructing the model to preserve the resume directive verbatim. Captures git state, plan status, session changes, @decision annotations, test status, agent findings, audit trail, and **session trajectory** (`get_session_summary_context`). Computes a **resume directive** via `build_resume_directive()` — a priority-ordered actionable instruction derived from session state (active agent > proof status > test failures > branch state > plan phase) — and appends it to both outputs so neither the `additionalContext` nor the persistent file omit the "what to do next" signal |
| **session-end.sh** | SessionEnd | Kills lingering async test-runner processes, releases todo claims for this session, cleans session-scoped files (`.session-changes-*`, `.prompt-count-*`, `.lint-cache`, strike counters). Preserves cross-session state (`.audit-log`, `.agent-findings`, `.plan-drift`). Trims audit log to last 100 entries |

### Stop Hooks

| Hook | Event | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **surface.sh** | Stop | Full decision audit pipeline: (1) extract — scans project source directories for @decision annotations using ripgrep (with grep fallback); (2) validate — checks changed files over 50 lines for @decision presence and rationale; (3) reconcile — compares DEC-IDs in MASTER_PLAN.md vs code, identifies unplanned decisions (in code but not plan) and unimplemented decisions (in plan but not code), respects deprecated/superseded status; (4) REQ-ID traceability — checks P0 requirements addressed by DEC-IDs via `Addresses:` linkage, flags unaddressed P0s; (5) persist — writes structured drift data (including `unaddressed_p0s`, `nogo_count`) to `.plan-drift` for consumption by plan-check.sh next session. Reports via `systemMessage` |
| **session-summary.sh** | Stop | Deterministic (<2s runtime). Counts unique files changed (source vs config), @decision annotations added. Reports git branch, dirty/clean state, test status (waits briefly for in-flight async test-runner). Generates workflow-aware next-action guidance: on main → "create plan" or "create worktrees"; on feature branch → "fix tests", "run tests", "review changes", or "merge to main" based on current state. Includes pending todo count |
| **forward-motion.sh** | Stop | Deterministic regex check (not AI). Extracts the last paragraph of the assistant's response and checks for forward motion indicators: `?`, "want me to", "shall I", "let me know", "would you like", "next step", etc. Returns exit 2 (feedback loop) only if the response ends with a bare completion statement ("done", "finished", "all set") and no question mark — prompting the model to add a suggestion or offer |

### Notifications

| Hook | Matcher | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **notify.sh** | permission_prompt\|idle_prompt | Desktop notification when Claude needs attention (macOS only). Uses `terminal-notifier` (activates terminal on click) with `osascript` fallback. Sound varies by urgency: `Ping` for permission prompts, `Glass` for idle prompts |

### Subagent Lifecycle

| Hook | Event / Matcher | What It Does |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **task-track.sh** | PreToolUse:Task | Tracks subagent spawns for status bar. **Dispatch gates**: Guardian requires `.proof-status = verified` when file exists (missing = allow, fixes bootstrap deadlock; meta-repo exempt). Tester requires implementer trace to have completed (prevents premature dispatch). **Implementer dispatch activates proof gate** by creating `.proof-status = needs-verification`. All gates use PreToolUse deny |
| **subagent-start.sh** | SubagentStart | Injects git state + plan status into every subagent. Agent-type-specific guidance: **Implementer** gets worktree creation warning (if none exist), test status. **Tester** gets implementer trace path, project type hints, branch context, verification protocol (includes Verification Assessment: methodology, coverage, confidence, gaps). **Guardian** gets plan update rules (only at phase boundaries) and test status. **Planner** gets research log status. Lightweight agents (Bash, Explore) get minimal context |
| **check-planner.sh** | SubagentStop (planner\|Plan) | 6 checks: (1) MASTER_PLAN.md exists, (2) has `## Phase N` headers, (3) has intent/vision section, (4) has issues/tasks, (5) approval-loop detection (agent ended with question but no plan completion confirmation), (6) has structured requirements sections — only flagged for multi-phase plans (single-phase/Tier 1 plans are expected to be brief). Advisory only — always exit 0. Persists findings to `.agent-findings` for next-prompt injection |
| **check-implementer.sh** | SubagentStop (implementer) | 4 checks: (1) current branch is not main/master (worktree was used), (2) @decision coverage on 50+ line source files changed this session, (3) approval-loop detection, (4) test status verification (recent failures = "implementation not complete"). Advisory only — proof-of-work verification moved to tester agent. Persists findings |
| **check-tester.sh** | SubagentStop (tester) | Validates tester completed verification: (1) `.proof-status` exists (at least pending), (2) trace artifacts include verification evidence. **Auto-verify**: if tester signals `AUTOVERIFY: CLEAN` and secondary validation confirms (High confidence, full coverage, no caveats), auto-writes `verified` to `.proof-status` — Guardian dispatch is immediately unblocked. Otherwise: if proof is `pending` → exit 0 with advisory (waiting for user approval). If proof missing → exit 2 (feedback loop: resume tester). Persists findings |
| **check-guardian.sh** | SubagentStop (guardian) | 5 checks: (1) MASTER_PLAN.md freshness — only for phase-completing merges, must be updated within 300s, (2) git status is clean (no uncommitted changes), (3) branch info for context, (4) approval-loop detection, (5) test status for git operations (CRITICAL if tests failing when merge/commit detected). Advisory only. Persists findings |
| **check-explore.sh** | SubagentStop (Explore\|explore) | Post-exploration validation for Explore agents. Validates research output quality. Advisory only — persists findings |
| **check-general-purpose.sh** | SubagentStop (general-purpose) | Post-execution validation for general-purpose agents. Validates output quality. Advisory only — persists findings |

## Key guard.sh Behaviors

The most complex hook — 11 checks covering 7 nuclear denies, 1 early-exit gate, 2 rewrites, 3 CWD safety denies, 3 hard blocks, 2 evidence gates, and 2 human gate enforcers.

**Nuclear deny** (Check 0 — unconditional, fires first):

| Category | Pattern | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Filesystem destruction | `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`, `rm -rf /Users`, `rm -rf /*` | Recursive deletion of system/user root directories |
| Disk/device destruction | `dd ... of=/dev/`, `mkfs`, `> /dev/sd*` | Overwrites or formats storage devices |
| Fork bomb | `:(){ :\|:& };:` | Infinite process spawning exhausts system resources |
| Permission destruction | `chmod 777 /`, `chmod -R 777 /*` | Removes all permission boundaries on root |
| System halt | `shutdown`, `reboot`, `halt`, `poweroff`, `init 0/6` | Stops or restarts the machine |
| Remote code execution | `curl/wget ... \| bash/sh/python/perl/ruby/node` | Executes untrusted downloaded code |
| SQL destruction | `DROP DATABASE/TABLE/SCHEMA`, `TRUNCATE TABLE` | Permanently destroys database objects |

False positive safety: `rm -rf ./node_modules` (scoped path), `curl ... | jq` (jq is not a shell), `chmod 755 ./build` (not 777 on root) all pass through.

**Early-exit gate** (after Check 1 — non-git commands skip all git-specific checks):

Strips quoted strings from the command, then checks if `git` appears in a command position (start of line, or after `&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`). If no git command is found, exits immediately — skipping checks 2–8. This prevents false positives where git subcommand keywords appear inside quoted arguments (e.g., `todo.sh add "fix git committing"` or `echo "git merge strategy"`).

**Transparent rewrites** (model's command silently replaced with safe alternative):

| Check | Trigger | Rewrite |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `/tmp/` or `/private/tmp/` write | → project `tmp/` directory (macOS symlink-aware; exempts Claude scratchpad) |
| 3 | `git push --force` (not to main) | → `--force-with-lease` |

**Hard blocks** (deny with explanation):

| Check | Trigger | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| 2 | `git commit` on main/master | Sacred Practice #2 (exempts `~/.claude` meta-repo and MASTER_PLAN.md-only commits) |
| 3 | `git push --force` to main/master | Destructive to shared history |
| 4 | `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`, `git branch -D` | Destructive operations — suggests safe alternatives |

**Evidence gates** (require proof before commit/merge):

| Check | Requires | State File | Exemption |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 6-7 | `.test-status` = `pass` (when file exists) | `.claude/.test-status` (format: `result\|fail_count\|timestamp`) | `~/.claude` meta-repo; missing file = allow (bootstrap path) |
| 8 | `.proof-status` = `verified` (when file exists) | `.claude/.proof-status` (format: `status\|timestamp`) | `~/.claude` meta-repo; missing file = allow (bootstrap path) |

Test evidence: only `pass` satisfies the gate when the file exists. Any non-pass status (`fail` of any age, unknown) = denied. Recent failures (< 10 min) get a specific error message with failure count; older failures get a generic "did not pass" message. Missing file = no test data to enforce = allowed (bootstrap path).

Proof-of-work: the user must see the feature work before code is committed. The gate is only active when `.proof-status` exists — created by implementer dispatch (task-track.sh Gate C writes `needs-verification`). Missing file means no implementation in progress, so commits are allowed (fixes bootstrap deadlock). `track.sh` resets proof status to `pending` when source files change after verification — ensuring the user always verifies the final state.

**Human gate enforcement** (Checks 9-10 — blocks agent bypass):

| Check | Trigger | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| 9 | Any Bash command writing approval status to `.proof-status` | Only `prompt-submit.sh` (user approval) and `check-tester.sh` (auto-verify) can write verified status. Guard.sh blocks Bash tool writes but not hook file operations |
| 10 | `rm` command targeting `.proof-status` when status is `pending` or `needs-verification` | Prevents agents from bypassing the gate by deleting the file. Verified status can be cleaned up freely |

---

## Key plan-check.sh Behaviors

Beyond checking for MASTER_PLAN.md existence, this hook scores plan staleness using two signals:

| Signal | What It Measures | Warn Threshold | Deny Threshold |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Source churn %** | Percentage of tracked source files changed since plan update | 15% | 35% |
| **Decision drift** | Count of unplanned + unimplemented @decision IDs (from `surface.sh` audit) | 2 IDs | 5 IDs |

The composite score takes the worst tier across both signals. If either hits deny threshold, writes are blocked until the plan is updated. This is self-normalizing — a 3-file project and a 300-file project both trigger at the same percentage.

**Bypasses:** Edit tool (inherently scoped), Write under 20 lines (trivial), non-source files, test files, non-git directories, `~/.claude` meta-infrastructure.

---

## Key auto-review.sh Behaviors

An 840-line policy engine that replaces the blunt "allow or ask" permission model with intelligent classification:

| Tier | Behavior | How It Decides |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **1 — Safe** | Auto-approve | Command is inherently read-only: `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `cd`, `echo`, `sort`, `wc`, `date`, etc. |
| **2 — Behavior-dependent** | Analyze subcommand + flags | `git status` ✅ auto-approve; `git rebase` ⚠️ advisory. Compound commands (`&&`, `\|\|`, `;`, `\|`) decomposed — every segment must be safe |
| **3 — Always risky** | Advisory context → defer to user | `rm`, `sudo`, `kill`, `ssh`, `eval`, `bash -c` — risk reason injected so the permission prompt explains *why* |

**Recursive analysis:** Command substitutions (`$()` and backticks) are analyzed to depth 2. `cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` auto-approves because both `cd` (Tier 1) and `git rev-parse` (Tier 2 → read-only) are safe.

**Dangerous flag escalation:** `--force`, `--hard`, `--no-verify`, `-f` (on git) escalate any command to risky regardless of tier.

**Interpreter analysis:** `python`, `node`, `ruby`, `perl` dispatch to `analyze_interpreter()` which distinguishes safe forms (script files, `-m module`, `--version`) from risky forms (`-c`/`-e` inline code, no-args interactive REPL). This mirrors the existing `analyze_shell()` pattern for `bash`/`sh`/`zsh`.

**Interaction with guard.sh:** Guard runs first (sequential in settings.json). If guard denies, auto-review never executes. If guard allows/passes through, auto-review classifies. This means guard handles the hard security boundaries, auto-review handles the UX of permission prompts.

**Permission evaluation order:** Hooks fire before the settings.json allow/deny lists. The full chain is: (1) PreToolUse hooks fire (guard.sh → auto-review.sh); (2) if a hook emits `permissionDecision: allow` → command proceeds with no prompt; (3) if a hook emits `permissionDecision: deny` → command blocked; (4) if no hook has an opinion → fall through to settings.json deny/allow rules; (5) if no rule matches → fall through to the permission mode (plan, default, etc.). This means most `Bash(echo *)`, `Bash(cat *)` entries in the settings.json allow list are redundant — auto-review.sh approves them as Tier 1 before the allow list is ever consulted.

**Git commit/push/merge reclassification:** These are classified as risky (return 1) rather than safe. This ensures every `git commit`, `git push`, and `git merge` triggers a user permission prompt, enforcing Guardian agent dispatch (Sacred Practice #8). Trade-off: Guardian's own git calls also trigger the prompt, meaning the user approves twice (Guardian plan + actual command). Acceptable — one extra click for mechanical enforcement.

## Enforcement Patterns

Three patterns recur across the hook system:

**Escalating gates** — warn on first offense, block on repeat. Used when the model may have a legitimate reason to proceed once, but repeat violations indicate a broken workflow.

| Hook | Strike File | Warn | Block |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| **test-gate.sh** | `.test-gate-strikes` | First source write with failing tests | Second source write without fixing tests |
| **mock-gate.sh** | `.mock-gate-strikes` | First internal mock detected | Second internal mock (external boundary mocks always allowed) |

**Feedback loops** — exit code 2 tells Claude Code to retry the operation with the hook's output as guidance, rather than failing outright. The model gets a chance to fix the issue automatically.

| Hook | Triggers exit 2 when |
|------|---------------------|
| **lint.sh** | Linter finds fixable issues in the written file |
| **plan-validate.sh** | MASTER_PLAN.md fails structural validation (missing Status fields, empty Decision Log, bad DEC-ID format) |
| **forward-motion.sh** | Response ends with bare completion ("done") and no question, suggestion, or offer |

**Deny with correction** — the command is denied with the safe alternative in the reason message. The model can resubmit the corrected command. Note: `updatedInput` transparent rewrites are NOT supported in PreToolUse hooks (silently fails — see issue anthropics/claude-code#26506).

| Hook | Denies with Correction |
|------|------------------------|
| **guard.sh** | `/tmp/` → denied, project `tmp/` path in message; `--force` → denied, `--force-with-lease` in message; `worktree remove` → denied, safe `cd`-first command in message |

## State Files

Hooks communicate across events through state files in the project's `.claude/` directory. This is the backbone that connects async test execution to commit-time evidence gates, session tracking to end-of-session audits, and compaction preservation to next-session context injection.

**Session-scoped** (cleaned up by session-end.sh):

| File | Written By | Read By | Contents |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| `.session-changes-$ID` | track.sh | surface.sh, session-summary.sh, check-implementer.sh, compact-preserve.sh | One file path per line — every Write/Edit this session |
| `.prompt-count-$ID` | prompt-submit.sh | prompt-submit.sh | Tracks whether first-prompt mitigation has fired |
| `.test-gate-strikes` | test-gate.sh | test-gate.sh | Strike count for escalating enforcement |
| `.mock-gate-strikes` | mock-gate.sh | mock-gate.sh | Strike count for escalating enforcement |
| `.test-runner.lock` | test-runner.sh | test-runner.sh | PID of active test process (prevents concurrent runs) |
| `.test-runner.last-run` | test-runner.sh | test-runner.sh | Epoch timestamp of last run (10s cooldown) |
| `.update-status` | update-check.sh | session-init.sh | `status\|local_ver\|remote_ver\|count\|timestamp\|summary` — one-shot, deleted after injection |
| `.update-check.lock` | update-check.sh | update-check.sh | PID of running update check (prevents concurrent runs) |

**Cross-session** (preserved by session-end.sh):

| File | Written By | Read By | Contents |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| `.test-status` | test-runner.sh | guard.sh (evidence gate), test-gate.sh, session-summary.sh, check-implementer.sh, check-guardian.sh, subagent-start.sh | `result\|fail_count\|timestamp` — cleared at session start by session-init.sh to prevent stale passes from satisfying the commit gate |
| `.proof-status` | tester agent writes `pending`, prompt-submit.sh writes `verified` on user approval, check-tester.sh writes `verified` on auto-verify (High confidence, clean e2e) | guard.sh (evidence gate), track.sh (invalidation), check-tester.sh, task-track.sh (Guardian gate) | `status\|timestamp` — `verified` or `pending`. prompt-submit.sh (user approval) and check-tester.sh (auto-verify) can write `verified`. guard.sh Check 9 blocks Bash tool writes but not hook file operations. track.sh resets to `pending` when source files change after verification |
| `.plan-drift` | surface.sh | plan-check.sh (staleness scoring) | Structured key=value: `unplanned_count`, `unimplemented_count`, `missing_decisions`, `total_decisions`, `source_files_changed`, `unaddressed_p0s`, `nogo_count` |
| `.agent-findings` | check-planner.sh, check-implementer.sh, check-guardian.sh | session-init.sh, prompt-submit.sh, compact-preserve.sh | `agent_type\|issue1;issue2` — cleared after injection (one-shot delivery) |
| `.preserved-context` | compact-preserve.sh | session-init.sh | Full session state snapshot — injected after compaction, then deleted (one-time use) |
| `.audit-log` | surface.sh, test-runner.sh, check-*.sh | compact-preserve.sh, session-summary.sh | Timestamped event trail — trimmed to last 100 entries by session-end.sh |

## settings.json Registration

Hook registration in `../settings.json` → `hooks` object:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "<EventName>": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolName|OtherTool",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/script.sh",
            "timeout": 5,
            "async": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Event names**: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `Stop`, `SessionEnd`
- **matcher**: Pipe-delimited tool names for PreToolUse/PostToolUse, agent types for SubagentStop, event subtypes for SessionStart/Notification. Optional — omit to match all.
- **timeout**: Seconds before hook is killed (default varies by event)
- **async**: `true` for fire-and-forget hooks (e.g., test-runner.sh)

## Testing

```bash
# PreToolUse:Write hook
echo '{"tool_name":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"/test.ts"}}' | bash hooks/<name>.sh

# PreToolUse:Bash hook
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | bash hooks/guard.sh

# Validate settings.json
python3 -m json.tool ../settings.json

# View audit trail
tail -20 ../.claude/.audit-log

# Check test gate status
cat <project>/.claude/.test-status
```
