# @decision DEC-SRCLIB-001
# @title Direct hook library sourcing (replaces session-scoped caching)
# @status accepted
# @rationale The previous caching mechanism (d6635ce) cached hook libraries
#   per session to prevent race conditions during concurrent git merges. However,
#   when cache population failed (permissions, disk full, missing session ID),
#   the source commands for log.sh and context-lib.sh were never reached. Since
#   all 29 hooks source this file, a single cache failure bricked the entire
#   hook system with no recovery path. Direct sourcing eliminates the failure
#   mode entirely. The theoretical git-merge race condition is mitigated by
#   session-init.sh's smoke test that validates library sourcing on startup.
