# SubagentStop:general-purpose — trace finalization for general-purpose agents.
# General-purpose agents are ad-hoc subagents dispatched without a specific role
# (implementer/planner/tester/guardian/explore). Without this handler, any trace
# they initialize will remain permanently "active" (orphaned) in the trace store.
#
# This hook is lightweight: it tracks the stop, finalizes the trace, and exits.
# No validation checks — general-purpose agents have no defined output contract.
#
# @decision DEC-GENERAL-STOP-001
# @title Add SubagentStop handler for general-purpose agents
# @status accepted
# @rationale General-purpose agents (matcher: "general-purpose" in settings.json)
#   have no SubagentStop handler, so their traces are never finalized. This creates
#   orphaned "active" traces in the trace store that inflate active-agent counts and
#   are never indexed. This handler mirrors the minimal pattern from check-explore.sh
#   but without overflow-detection logic (general-purpose agents have no response
#   size contract). If detect_active_trace returns empty, we log to audit — this is
#   expected for general-purpose agents that didn't initialize a trace.
