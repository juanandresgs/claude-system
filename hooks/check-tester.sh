# SubagentStop:tester — validation of tester output with auto-verify support.
# Checks that the tester completed its verification job:
#   - .proof-status exists (at least pending)
#   - If tester signals AUTOVERIFY: CLEAN with High confidence and full coverage,
#     auto-writes verified status (bypasses manual approval)
#   - If still pending → exit 0 with advisory (user approval flow)
#   - If verified → exit 0 (Guardian dispatch unblocked)

# @title Tester SubagentStop with auto-verify for clean e2e verifications
# @status accepted
# @rationale The tester presents evidence and writes .proof-status = pending.
#   If the tester signals AUTOVERIFY: CLEAN and secondary validation confirms
#   (High confidence, full coverage, no caveats), this hook auto-writes
#   verified — bypassing manual approval. Otherwise, the user must approve.
#   Guard.sh Check 9 only blocks Bash tool writes, not hook file operations.
#   track.sh resets proof if source files change post-verification.

#   as their primary artifact, not test-output.txt. A tester with
#   verification-output.txt IS complete even if finalize_trace shows "partial".
