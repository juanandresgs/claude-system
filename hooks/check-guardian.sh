# check-guardian.sh — SubagentStop:guardian hook
#
# Purpose: Deterministic post-guardian validation. Checks MASTER_PLAN.md recency,
# git cleanliness, test status, and approval-loop state after each guardian run.
# Cleans up .proof-status after a successful commit to reset the verification cycle.
# Advisory only (exit 0 always). Reports findings via additionalContext.
#
# Hook type: SubagentStop
# Trigger: After any Task tool invocation that ran the guardian agent
# Input: JSON on stdin with agent response text
# Output: JSON { "additionalContext": "..." } with validation findings
#
# @decision DEC-GUARDIAN-001
# @title Deterministic guardian validation replacing AI agent hook
# @status accepted
# @rationale AI agent hooks have non-deterministic runtime and cascade risk.
# File stat + git status complete in <1s with zero cascade risk. Post-commit
# .proof-status cleanup (Phase B) ensures the verification gate resets cleanly
# for the next implementation cycle, preventing stale "verified" state from
# bypassing the proof gate on subsequent tasks.

# @title Order finalize_trace before advisory checks to prevent stale .active-* markers
# @status accepted
# @rationale The 5s SubagentStop hook timeout means any code after the budget is consumed
#   is silently skipped. If get_git_state, get_plan_status, and ~150 lines of advisory
#   checks run before finalize_trace, the .active-guardian-* marker is never removed on
#   timeout. Stale markers from previous guardian runs can interfere with future dispatch.
#   Fix: detect trace, write summary.md fallback (which finalize_trace depends on), call
#   finalize_trace, THEN run advisory checks. Auto-capture (commit-info.txt) stays after
#   finalize_trace since it's best-effort artifact enrichment, not marker cleanup.
