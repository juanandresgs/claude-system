# observatory/.gitignore — exclude runtime state from version control
#
# Purpose: The observatory/ dir holds persistent runtime state (state.json,
#          history.jsonl, suggestions/, analysis-cache.json). These are created
#          on first run and should not be committed — they belong to the
#          local machine and accumulate over time.
#
# Only the .gitignore itself is committed so the directory is tracked.

# Runtime state files
state.json
history.jsonl
analysis-cache.json

# Generated suggestion files
suggestions/

# Temp files
*.tmp
