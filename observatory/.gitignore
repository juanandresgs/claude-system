# observatory/.gitignore — exclude runtime state from version control
#
# Purpose: The observatory/ dir holds persistent runtime state (state.json,
#          metrics.json, metrics-history.jsonl, history.jsonl). These are
#          created on first run and should not be committed — they belong to
#          the local machine and accumulate over time.
#
# Only the .gitignore itself is committed so the directory is tracked.

# Runtime state files (v4 schema)
state.json
history.jsonl
metrics.json
metrics-history.jsonl

# Generated report (regenerated on each run)
assessment-report.md

# Legacy v3 files (now replaced by metrics.json + metrics-history.jsonl)
analysis-cache.json
analysis-cache.prev.json
comparison-matrix.json

# Generated suggestion files (replaced by suggestions[] in state.json)
suggestions/

# Temp files
*.tmp
