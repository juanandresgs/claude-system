## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `feature/project-isolation`: Cross-project state isolation via 8-char SHA-256 project hash — scopes .proof-status, .active-worktree-path, and trace markers per project root to prevent state contamination across concurrent Claude Code sessions; three-tier backward-compatible lookup; 20 new isolation tests

### Changed
- `feature/observatory-stdout`: Observatory report.sh now prints a concise stdout summary (regressions, health, signals, batches) after writing the full report file, so callers get actionable output without reading the file

### Fixed
- `fix/sigpipe-crashes`: SIGPIPE (exit 141) crashes in session-init.sh and context-lib.sh when MASTER_PLAN.md has large sections — replaced 20 pipe patterns with SIGPIPE-safe equivalents (awk inline limits, bash builtins, single-pass awk); added 14-test SIGPIPE resistance suite
- `fix/stale-marker-blocking-tester`: Stale `.active-*` marker race condition blocking tester dispatch — reorder `finalize_trace` before timeout-heavy ops in check-implementer.sh and check-guardian.sh, add marker cleanup in `refinalize_trace()`, add completed-status fast path in task-track.sh Gate B

### Added
- `feature/plan-redesign-tests`: Phase 4 test suite for living plan format — 16 new tests across 2 suites (test-plan-lifecycle.sh, test-plan-injection.sh) validating initiative lifecycle edge cases and bounded session injection; bug fix for empty Active Initiatives section returning active instead of dormant (#142)

### Changed
- `feature/living-plan-hooks`: Living MASTER_PLAN format — initiative-level lifecycle with dormant/active states, get_plan_status() rewrite, plan-validate.sh structural validation, bounded session-init injection (796->81 lines), compress_initiative() for archival (#140)
- `refactor/shared-library`: Phase 8 shared library consolidation — 13 hooks converted from raw jq to `get_field()`, `get_session_changes()` ported to context-lib.sh with glob fallback, SOURCE_EXTENSIONS unified, context-lib.sh chmod 755; plus DEC-PROOF-PATH-003 meta-repo proof-status double-nesting fix (#7, #137)
- **Planner create-or-amend workflow** — `agents/planner.md` rewritten (391->629 lines) to support both creating new MASTER_PLAN.md and amending existing living documents with new initiatives; auto-detects plan format via `## Identity` marker (#139)
- **Tester agent rewrite** — 8 targeted fixes for 37.5% failure rate: feature-match validation, test infrastructure discovery, early proof-status write, hook/script table split, worktree path safety, meta-infra exception, retry limits, mandatory trace protocol

### Added
- **Documentation audit** — 38 discrepancies resolved: hardcoded hook counts removed, 3 undocumented hooks documented, /approve eradicated, updatedInput contradiction corrected, tester max_turns fixed

- **Checkpoint System** — Git ref-based snapshots before writes with `/rewind` restore skill (`hooks/checkpoint.sh`, `skills/rewind/`)
- **CWD Recovery** — Three-path system for worktree deletion CWD death spiral: directed recovery (Check 0.5 Path A), canary-based recovery (Path B), prevention (Check 0.75) in `guard.sh`
- **Cross-Session Learning** — Session-aware hooks with trajectory guidance, friction pattern detection (v2 Phase 4)
- **Session Summaries in Commits** — Structured session context embedded in commit metadata (v2 Phase 2)
- **Session-Aware Hooks** — Trajectory-based guidance, compaction-safe resume directives (v2 Phase 3)
- **SDLC Integrity Layer** — Guard hardening, state hygiene, preflight checks (Phase A)
